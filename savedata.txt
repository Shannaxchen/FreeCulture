ABOUTUS
	We are New York City enthusiasts who are always surprised by the constant stream of new and exciting things to discover throughout the city, and not all of them require a lot of money. Culture on the Cheap is a guide to free & cheap cultural events ranging from art and music shows to performances, talks, walks, food and more. We curate this bulletin board based on what looks interesting to us, but it goes without saying that we cannot personally attend all that is listed.<br /><br />If you would like to submit an event, hit the "Submit" tab at the top right. Please include a one- or two-sentence description with a link to the event's page that includes all information (date/time/location/cost) and a compelling image under 200kb. <br /><br />We cannot include all submissions, but will look at them all and post those that fit in well with Culture on the Cheap.<br /><br />If you would prefer to email your submission, you can do so at cultureonthecheap@gmail.com. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Web Site Development: <a href='mailto:jqtran@cs.brown.edu'>John Tran</a> || <a href='mailto:christopher.m.piette@gmail.com'>Chris Piette</a> || <a href = 'mailto:annaliasunderland@gmail.com'> Annalia Sunderland </a> || <a href = 'mailto:shannaxchen@gmail.com'>Shanna Chen </a> || <a href = 'mailto:hyoju_lim@brown.edu'>Hyoju Lim </a><br /><br /><br />
